The ceiling starts to vanish, accompanied by the electronic music synthesizers. The illusion of a hologram makes its dark edges blur to make way for a vibrant blue colour, loaded with constellations that explode, just like fireworks. They cast coloured shapes, reflecting in BI’s eyes, attentive, observing how elevated up high they start to descend, their bodies hooked on translucent fabrics, dancing in the air. RE slides along with agile, elastic movements. Neon lights dye his body, sometimes turquoise, violet and magenta while he coils up, pushing himself into the fabric. He meets BI’s gaze when he floats face down, arcing his neck to the ceiling, sustained by the strength in his legs. He stretches an arm surrounded by fabric, spreading it over his table. He holds it in his hands, painting them with glitter. He cracks a tranquil smile and his eyes close for a few moments until the music is coming from further and further away, just like an echo, followed by the sensation that the fabric has on him when he strokes it, melting away in his fingers. 
RE isn’t there. In her place, the dark, empty ceiling. BI’s eyes move from side to side, searching for the illusory sky. But she only finds the trace of the turquoise glitter that got stuck to the skin on her hand, glittering with the movements of her fingers, as if she were still dancing.
