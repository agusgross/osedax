The mirror reflects what is happening behind him, shows him images of the hubbub formed by other people’s conversations. RE watches them transformed into clouds; ghosts floating like blurred figures, moving from one side to the other amid the smoke of their cigarettes, some pausing to help dress themselves, agitatedly taking down the clothes that hang on metal hangers. 
VM is sitting next to him, finishing her makeup. His silver lips move, speak to her. But she doesn’t listen. She smiles, nods as she opens a jar of turquoise glitter. She dips a brush in it and paints her eyelids. She smells her friend’s breath again, an aroma of liquor that carries away her words as she gesticulates, making them sweet, inaudible, like the voices of the people surrounding them. Then she colours her cheeks and raises her head, pausing in the mirror. She observes the person looking back at her; the lost eyes, the glitter enveloping her face like a shiny headscarf. RE checks her out as if she were a stranger. She immerses herself in her completely until VM gets up from her chair, caressing her shoulder as she passes. This is enough stimulus to throw off her concentration, making her nod slightly and stand up. She walks to the end of the room, mingling with the rest of her companions, now crowding under the door.
