“Who? Who’s been taken?” Silence. “BI, answer me. Who’s been taken?”
“RE, he... he isn’t here.”
“What do you mean he isn’t there?”
“Please...” His voice breaks. “Please, come.”
“Where are you? Are you at home?” Receiving no reply, she insists. “BI! Are you at home?”
“Yes...” he manages to say, wiping a tear from his cheek. 
“I’m on my way. Wait there, I’m on my way.”
NU hangs up and BI stays there with her phone to her ear, looking at RE’s body, his lost eyes. She puts the phone in her sweatpants pocket and cautiously goes over to him. She strokes a lock of his hair, looking at him sweetly, almost melancholy. Then she looks down to his neck, where the tattoo of the fine stem of a flower grows to the side of his ear, its round petals expanding. A poppy. Broken now, split in two by a seam of transparent thread. BI takes her hand off RE’s hair, and shakes it in the air as if she’d burned it. She puts it to her face, covering her mouth as her eyes grow red. She stifles a cry. She walks to the door and stops under the doorframe, beating it. She puts her forehead to her forearm, leaning against it. She turns her head to RE and looks away immediately, hitting the wall again and again. Then she grips the gun in her hand and leaves, slamming the door shut. RE’s body lies abandoned in the middle of the narrow room. His hands grip the sheets as if he were snuggling from the cold, his face relaxed, dreaming deeply.
