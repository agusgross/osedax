The rain leaks through the chipped edges of the windows, stained with damp. Sitting, BI hides the weapon behind one of the armchair cushions. She gets up, puts her thumb on the door knob, slides the deadlock and opens the door, finding NU on the other side. His hair is wet from the rain, slicked against his temples; he comes in with his hands in his coat pockets. 
“NU, we have to do something...” BI starts to say to him quickly, her words piling on top of each other. 
He interrupts her. “Where is he?” he asks calmly.
BI points to a door behind the armchairs and puts her hand down immediately, sharply. 
“Help me look for him... we have to look for her, NU,” she continues, walking to the room with him. NU cracks the door and BI steps back, closing her eyes tight shut. “I can’t... I can’t look at him. Get him out, get him out of here!” she shouts. She covers her face with one hand, her trembling body leaning against the door frame. “Why... why are they doing this?” she stammers amid the tears. “We talked, he said he had something to tell me and... I don’t know... I don’t know what it is... what was it?” She finds it hard to say, distant like a stooping figure. 
NU goes over to her, puts a warm hand on her shoulder.
