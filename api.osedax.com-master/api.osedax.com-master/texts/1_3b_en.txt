“Home,” he replies, with a whisper. “Your home, BI.” Then he looks up, inquiring with a mischievous grin: “Will you let me come with you?”
BI laughs as she leans back on his shoulder again. They swing a few minutes, as if dancing to imaginary music. 
“What happened, RE?” asks BI, breaking the silence. 
“With what?”
“What were you thinking,” he insists, “when you didn't know I was here?”
“Nothing, it’s just that...” She sighs despondently, withdrawing from his arms. “It’s... it’s this place. It seems I’m not used to it yet. Sometimes I feel like I don’t... that I'm not here,” she struggles to finish. “I see myself, but... it’s as if I wasn’t real.” She pauses and says to him with the same expression that was reflected on the grey screens: “I’m not here, BI.”
“What do you mean you’re not here? RE, what are you talking about? You’re always here. I see you...” She stops talking. She frowns, thinks for a second. “If you mean all those things that they don’t feel, that they execute... you... you’re not like that. Don’t compare yourself with those robots. They’re fake. They don’t know how to dance, they mimic. You don’t. I always tell you this, you don’t need me to say it again....” She puts a hand on his face when she sees he’s looking down. She strokes a cheek with her fingers. “Look at me. You’re here. Don’t go.”
RE cracks a shy smile. She holds his hand and kisses him slowly, pressing herself against his lips. Then she looks him in the eye. BI makes out the vibrant turquoise colour of her makeup again, the eyelids decorated with glitter, unlike the eyes of the screens, observing them, grey.
