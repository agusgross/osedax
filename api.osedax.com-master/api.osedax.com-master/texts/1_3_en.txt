He cracks the door and glimpses RE at the back of the room, in front of one of the high walls, covered with screens. They fit the whole of his face, projecting features that change as he selects them quickly from his telephone, as if they were part of an animated sequence. BI walks slowly into the place. He walks to a screen and watches it in silence, concentrating on every detail, every pixel that reflects RE. His face changes in less time than it takes to blink. Crossing over him are different illuminations, different colours, effects that make his eyelashes longer, refine his nose and thicken his lips. They move faster and faster, almost simultaneously with RE’s expression, twisting in disgust, contorting until his mouth produces a sound. He utters it forcefully, like a stifled cry as the effects stop moving over his face, leaving her submerged in shades of grey. He seems to be watching BI, his eyes discoloured, cornering him in the room with a look that gradually fades, vanishing into the screens. BI shakes his head, perplexed. He walks over to him immediately.
“RE... are you...? Are you OK?” she says, stroking his shoulder.
“BI! Hi, yeah...” she replies with a jump, turning his head to him. I didn’t see you, you came up very quickly.” He smiles at her, trying to hide the tears that had started to well in his eyes.
“RE...”
“I want to go...” he interrupts her, his voice barely audible. His smile slowly fades as a tear runs down his cheek. He hurries over to him, putting his head on his shoulder.
“No, no...” says BI, softly. She holds him tight, brushing his hair
against her cheek. “Why... Where...? Where do you want to go?” There is a brief silence and she adds: “Let me come with you.”
