“I'm going to cover him with the sheets now. We’ll get him out of here, OK?” he says, lowering his head to catch her eye. 
BI nods several times while NU walks slowly, going back into the room. NU’s eyes turn red as she watches her. The naked body, inert on the bed. She moves it delicately, wrapping it in the sheets as if it were a fragile thing, about to snap.
“BI, I need a suitcase,” she says, getting her breath back, after a sigh. She turns, looks around. “Where...?” she starts to ask, but BI is one step ahead, sliding the wardrobe door over her words. He grabs a suitcase and puts it next to his legs, making a cracking noise. NU moves it to the end of the bed, opens it. She turns her head to the wrapped-up figure on the mattress and picks it up without effort, as if it were a feather. 
Then a foot slips out, freeing itself from the wrapping made from sheets. The seam across her ankle breaks with NU’s movements, showing the beginnings of a flower. A flower that comes away, followed by another, accompanied by little fragments of earth. BI finds them, looking at them with astonished eyes, as they fall to the floor. One after the other, freeing themselves from the undone seam. Wild flowers. Grass. She remembers the poppy tattooed on RE’s neck as her eyes start to spin. She closes them with a frown, a gesture of pain, as if they were stinging and she couldn’t keep them open. She walks backwards clumsily, she leans back on a wall and listens to the sound of the suitcase, the zips sliding quickly, closing it. She imagines the body. The open seams, filling the suitcase with petals. She wonders if they will have an aroma. Leaves, stems, sap. Whether they would perfume the fabric of the sheets.
